## Can I compete against you guys?

Of course! 

1. Create (or reuse) an ssh key.
2. Send the public part to joakim.gustin@evolvetechnology.se or niklas.ingholt@evolvetechnology.se
3. Your project needs to be a git repository. Doesn't need to be pushed anywhere just for local development.
4. Add our game server as remote: `git remote add dokku dokku@battlesnake.evolvetechnology.se:TEAMNAME` and replace with your team name.
5. Try to deploy with `git push dokku master`

Our server is located at the following address [battlesnake.evolvetechnology.se](http://battlesnake.evolvetechnology.se/).
