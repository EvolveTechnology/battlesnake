# BattleSnake

BattleSnake is a fun programming competition where teams of developers builds AIs for a multiplayer version of the classic arcade game "Snake".

It's originally a hosted competition in Victoria, BC (Canada) but the organizers have been kind enough to provide a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/stembolt/battle_snake/) of their game server, allowing us to host our own competitions!

## Instructions

Each team develops an AI, responsible for controlling the movement of your snake. Communication between the game server and each snake is made via a HTTP REST api as specified in the [documentation](https://stembolthq.github.io/battle_snake/).

Multiple teams will compete on the same board at the same time, and the winner will be the last team slithering!

## Snake boilerplates

These boilerplates will help you get started competing in BattleSnake.

- Node [node-boilerplate](https://github.com/EvolveTechnology/battlesnake/tree/master/node-boilerplate)
- .NET Core [netcore-boilerplate](https://github.com/EvolveTechnology/battlesnake/tree/master/netcore-boilerplate)

## Can I compete against you guys?

Do you know what?! That would be so much fun! Just follow the following instructions and get to hacking:

1. Make your snake publicly available, e.g. on Heroku. (Or if you're an Evolve employee, contact [@gust1n](https://github.com/gust1n) or [@niklasi](https://github.com/niklasi) for access to our snake server)
1. Go to [battlesnake.evolvetechnology.se](http://battlesnake.evolvetechnology.se)
1. Create a new game and add the URL of your snake as a player. A list of possible opponents can be found below.
1. Game away, and make sure to mock us if (when) you beat us!
1. Add your snake URL to the list below.
